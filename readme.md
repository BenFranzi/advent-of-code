# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my Advent of Code repo! This is where I store my solutions for the annual coding 
challenge.

## How to run the solutions

For every type of project in this repository, here is how to start it. These should be sensible enough, but 
I've added them here just in case I try something really strange and need to remember how it goes.

### Rust
To run the main
> cargo run

to run the tests
> cargo test
